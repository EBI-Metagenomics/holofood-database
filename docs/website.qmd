# Finding Samples
![Screenshot of sample listing webpage](/img/website/find-samples.png)
Samples can be found from the "Chicken samples" and "Salmon samples" navigation items.
On the samples listing pages, there are various filters available to limit which samples are shown in the table.
For example, you can find all samples from a particular project.

The table shows an icon-key detailing which data types are available for each sample.
Samples may be linked to metadata (almost always), metagenomic, or metabolomic datasets.

To view detail about a particular sample, click "View" on its row of the table.

The sample detail page contains information help about the sample in the various supporting databases.
Metadata is shown in full, in a table.
Metagenomic and metabolomic data are shown in summary form, with links to the respective public websites where those analyses are held.

The [API](api.ipynb) section shows the API endpoint for this particular sample.
You can copy this into a script, for example, to programmatically pull the data.
