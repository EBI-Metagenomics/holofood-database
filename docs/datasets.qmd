All HoloFood samples are registered in the [European Nucleotide Archive](https://ebi.ac.uk/ena), 
which has [extensive documentation](https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/).

Most analyses of the samples are stored in further appropriate supporting databases, 
with a small number hosted directly in the HoloFood data portal.

## ENA Studies (Projects)
An ENA Study (or Project) is part of the [ENA Metadata Model](https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submit/general-guide/metadata.html#metadata-model).
> A study (project) groups together data submitted to the archive and controls its release date. A study accession is typically used when citing data submitted to ENA.

## ENA Samples
An ENA Sample is part of the [ENA Metadata Model](https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submit/general-guide/metadata.html#metadata-model).
> A sample contains information about the sequenced source material. Samples are associated with checklists, which define the fields used to annotate the samples.

## ENA Checklist Metadata
An [ENA Checklist](https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/retrieval/ena-project.html?highlight=checklist#sample-checklists) 
is a set of metadata (some mandatory) for a given sample type.

The HoloFood checklist is [ERC000052](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/ERC000052).

## BioSamples Metadata
BioSamples is an EBI service hosting annotations keyed against an existing sample hosted elsewhere (in HoloFood's case, ENA).
For HoloFood biosamples, these are registered against a specific ontology.

The majority of HoloFood samples' metadata are hosted in BioSamples.

There is a [BioSamples online training course](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/courses/biosamples-quick-tour/what-is-biosamples)
to learn more.

## MGnify: Metagenomics
Metagenomic-derived analyses are available for some HoloFood samples.

These datasets and analysis features are hosted by [MGnify](https://ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics), which also has [extensive documentation](https://docs.mgnify.org/).

> MGnify is a freely available hub for the analysis and exploration of metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, amplicon and assembly data.

## MetaboLights: Metabolomics
Metabolomics-derived analyses are avaulable for some HoloFood samples.

These datasets are hosted by [MetaboLights](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/).

## Summary analyses
Summary analyses are higher level analyses of a Sample or collection of Samples; 
written documents serving as short analysis summaries.

These summaries are hosted directly by the HoloFood data portal.

The documents are written by HoloFood partners and moderated by the HoloFood consortium, 
but are not peer-reviewed research articles.

Each analysis summary is linked to one or more Samples that were included in the analysis or are relevant to it.
