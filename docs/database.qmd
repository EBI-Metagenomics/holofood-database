title: "Database snapshots"

Snapshots of the data portal database are available from the [EBI FTP server](https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/metagenomics/holofood_data/)

For most multi-omics data queries, the [API](api.ipynb) provides a set of endpoints to retrieve the desired filtered dataset. 
However, users may also download a SQLite file of the data portal database if they prefer to query it directly â€“ e.g. to more quickly retrieve many queries.

The database is a [SQLite3](https://www.sqlite.org/) file. Tools to query these databases exist on every platform and for many programming languages. Python has built-in support for them.

As a realistic example of it's use, the following SQL query would retrieve a list of chickens' host genome sample accessions alongside inflammatory marker sample accessions from the same bird, and the dietary treatment of the host animals:

```sql
select holofood_animal.accession      as animal,
       genomic_samples.accession      as genomic_sample,
       inflammatory_samples.accession as inflammatory_sample,
       ha.measurement                 as treatment
from holofood_animal
         left join (select *
                    from holofood_sample
                    where sample_type = 'host_genomic') genomic_samples
                   on holofood_animal.accession = genomic_samples.animal_id
         left join (select *
                    from holofood_sample
                    where sample_type = 'inflammatory_markers') inflammatory_samples
                   on holofood_animal.accession = inflammatory_samples.animal_id
         join holofood_animalstructureddatum ha on holofood_animal.accession = ha.animal_id
         join holofood_samplemetadatamarker hs on hs.id = ha.marker_id
where hs.name = 'Treatment name'
  and system = 'chicken'
  and genomic_sample is not null
  and inflammatory_sample is not null
