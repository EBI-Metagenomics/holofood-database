MAGs are draft genomes created by binning assembled metagenomic reads. These MAGs are created using the MGnify Genomes Pipeline. MAGs are annotated using various functional and taxonomic characterisation tools.\nHoloFood MAGs are those created using only reads from HoloFood samples. However, there are other non-HoloFood public data available for the same biomes sampled by this project.\nEach HoloFood MAG Catalogue therefore referenced a public MAG Catalogue in MGnify, which is a superset of the HoloFood data and other public data.\nEach MAG in the HoloFood catalogue references a MAG in the MGnify catalogue which represents the same species. In some cases, the HoloFood MAG is the best available sequence for that species level cluster, so the HoloFood MAG points to itself on the MGnify website. In other cases, a more complete, less contaminated, or isolate genome exists representing the same species, so the HoloFood MAG points to this better representative on MGnify.\n\n\nViral (fragment) Catalogues\nViral catalogues are lists of the unique (at species-level) viruses found in HoloFood samples. Viral sequences are detected using VIRify. Viruses are shown as fragments (regions) of the parent contigs in which they were found. The contigs are those stored in MGnify, from the HoloFood Sample sequencing. Annotations are available on the contigs from the MGnify analysis pipeline."
