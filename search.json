HoloFood MAGs are those created using only reads from HoloFood samples. However, there are other non-HoloFood public data available for the same biomes sampled by this project.\nEach HoloFood MAG Catalogue therefore referenced a public MAG Catalogue in MGnify, which is a superset of the HoloFood data and other public data. This is linked from each catalogue page on the HoloFood Data Portal site.\nEach MAG in the HoloFood catalogue references a MAG in the MGnify catalogue which represents the same species. In some cases, the HoloFood MAG is the best available sequence for that species level cluster, so the HoloFood MAG points to itself on the MGnify website. In other cases, a more complete, less contaminated, or isolate genome exists representing the same species, so the HoloFood MAG points to this better representative on MGnify.\n\n\n\nScreenshot of a MAG catalogue\n\n\nMAG Catalogues can be found from the “Genomes” navigation item, and then selecting a catalogue in the “Catalogues” sub-navigation. MAGs can be found by searching on accession or taxonomy, or for the accession of the cluster representative.\nThe MAGs in a catalogue can be downloaded as a TSV file, using the “Download all as TSV” button.\n\n\nViral Catalogues\n Viral catalogues are lists of the unique (at species-level) viruses found in HoloFood samples. Viral catalogues can be found from the “Viruses” navigation item, and then selecting a catalogue in the “Catalogues” sub-navigation.\nViral fragment can be searched in various ways, like the parent contig ID, or the taxonomy of the host MAG. Host MAGs are only assigned where there is an exact match between the viral sequence and a host MAG.\nBy default, only species-level clusters are shown (a representative viral fragment is shown).\nThis can be changed either by clicking the “View cluster” link within the table, to see the remainder of that specific cluster, or by changing the “Cluster visibility” dropdown in the filters to the left of the table.\nPressing “View contig” on a viral fragment in the table opens the contig viewer. This loads the contig from MGnify, as well as MGnify’s annotations on the contig. These can be explored in more detail by clicking the parent contig in the table, which links to MGnify.\nIn the contig viewer, ViPhOG annotations are shown. These are unique to the data portal. The viral region is highlighted in green. The GFF containing the ViPhOG(s) can also be downloaded, by viewing a viral fragment and pressing “Download ViPhOGs GFF”."

    "text": "MGnify: Metagenomics\nMetagenomic-derived analyses are available for some HoloFood samples.\nThese datasets and analysis features are hosted by MGnify, which also has extensive documentation.\n\nMGnify is a freely available hub for the analysis and exploration of metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, amplicon and assembly data.\n\n\nMetagenome Assembled Genome (MAG) Catalogues\nMAG Catalogues are available for selected biomes. MAGs are draft genomes created by binning assembled metagenomic reads. These MAGs are created using the MGnify Genomes Pipeline. MAGs are annotated using various functional and taxonomic characterisation tools.\nHoloFood MAGs are those created using only reads from HoloFood samples. However, there are other non-HoloFood public data available for the same biomes sampled by this project.\nEach HoloFood MAG Catalogue therefore referenced a public MAG Catalogue in MGnify, which is a superset of the HoloFood data and other public data.\nEach MAG in the HoloFood catalogue references a MAG in the MGnify catalogue which represents the same species. In some cases, the HoloFood MAG is the best available sequence for that species level cluster, so the HoloFood MAG points to itself on the MGnify website. In other cases, a more complete, less contaminated, or isolate genome exists representing the same species, so the HoloFood MAG points to this better representative on MGnify.\n\n\nViral (fragment) Catalogues\nViral catalogues are lists of the unique (at species-level) viruses found in HoloFood samples. Viral sequences are detected using VIRify. Viruses are shown as fragments (regions) of the parent contigs in which they were found. The contigs are those stored in MGnify, from the HoloFood Sample sequencing. Annotations are available on the contigs from the MGnify analysis pipeline."
